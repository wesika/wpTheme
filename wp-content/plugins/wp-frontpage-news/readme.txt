This plugin is the official long-awaited **replacement to the popular [YD Recent Posts Widget With Thumnails plugin for WordPress](http://www.yann.com/en/wp-plugins/yd-recent-posts-widget)** that I developed a few years ago and was no longer maintained. Its out-of-the box features are equivalent to the former plugin, with full WP3.6+ compatibility and guaranteed support. Enjoy!
